# GLFWSuperSecretProject
Please note the very limited functionality.

Core.cpp and Core.hpp is where user code should be put.

A Runner object controls the main game loop. There is currently only functionality to draw polygons, rectangles and triangles. However this will quickly be expanded to images, other shapes, implementation of key events and possibly sound.

See Graphics.hpp for possible graphics.
